				<h2>Wrap Media, LLC Privacy Policy</h2>
				<h3>Last Updated: May 29, 2015</h3>
<p>
Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive through our Services. When we say “Services” in this Privacy Policy, we mean our corporate website located at www.wrap.co (the “Site”), our web-based authoring tool that we make available to our enterprise customers for building app-like messages that are delivered as card-based, swipe-able content by way of an html link and viewable in the mobile browser (“Wraps”), and our Wraps.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services. Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service and our SaaS Services Agreement. So, please make sure that you have read and understand these documents to the extent they apply to your use of the Services.
</p>
<h3>Revisions to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate when those changes will become effective.
</p>
<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<h4>Information Collected or Received from You</h4>
<p>
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services.
Personally Identifiable Information. To the extent we allow users to sign up to use of any of the Services, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you (“PII”), such as your name and email address, and we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you. If you are using our web-authoring tool as an employee of an enterprise customer, we may collect PII such as your name and email address in connection with such use.  Additionally, we or our payment processors may also collect PII such as your name, email address, and credit card or other billing information in connection with purchases you make within the Services.	
 </p>
 <p>
Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. We use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.
</p>
<p>
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third parties.  We may also use HTML5 local storage to store information locally within your browser such as user preferences and number of visits whenever you access our Services.
</p>
<p>
“Web Beacons” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail). 
</p>
<p>
Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on, ads that a User clicked on within the Services, a User’s behavior and transaction related information while using the Services (such as videos and pages viewed within a Wrap), and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used.
Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device identifier (such as IDFA or Android ID), user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use of our Services.
 </p>
 <p>
Location Information. When you use our Services, we may collect and store information about your location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device. 
 </p>
<h3>Information that We Share with Third Parties</h3>
<h4>We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:</h4>
 <p>
Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your information, including PII, only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. 
Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share certain anonymized information with third-party advertising partners. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.  We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. to gather information about how Users engage with our Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit <a target="_blank" href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</a>
</p>
<p>
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.
</p>

<h3>Responding to Do Not Track Signals</h3>
<p>Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web browsers.</p>
<h3>The Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. We utilize industry standard security measures to protect against external threats which include firewalls, strict configuration management, multi-zone architecture and a default deny-all access level.  Internal controls include an ISO 2700x aligned information security program with provisions for strictly limited and formally implemented access control management, log management and ongoing policy and educational controls including security awareness training with specific audibility and executive oversight.  Please be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
 </p>
<h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>
Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a “Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.
 </p>
<h3>International Transfer</h3>
<p>
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.
 </p>
<h3>Our Policy Toward Children</h3>
<p>
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as possible.
 </p>
