				<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<h4>Last Updated: August 31, 2015</h4>
 <p>
Welcome! Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they govern your use of Wrap Media, LLC’s website located at www.wrap.co (the “Site”), our web-based authoring tool and analytics dashboard (“Authoring Platform”) for building and managing app-like messages that are delivered as card-based, swipe-able content by way of an html link and viewable in the mobile browser (“Wraps”), and our Wraps.  To make these Terms easier to read, the Site, the Authoring Platform, and our Wraps are collectively called the “Services.”
 </p>
<h3>Agreement to Terms</h3>
<p>
By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to these Terms, do not use the Services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity.
 </p>
<h3>Changes to Terms or Services</h3>
<p>
We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if you continue to use the Services after we have posted modified Terms on the Site, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.
 <p>
<h3>Who May Use the Services</h3>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>
You may use the Services only if you are 13 years or older and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.
</p>

<h4>Registration and Your Information</h4>
<p>
If you want to use certain features of the Services you’ll have to have an account (“Account”). You can create an Account via the Site, or you can login to an existing Account created by your employer.    You’ll be able to create or login to your Account, as applicable, through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook (each, an “SNS Account”). If you choose the SNS Account option we’ll create or log you into your Account, as applicable, by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.  It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information, as needed, to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don’t, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you’ll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.
 </p>
<h3>Using the Services</h3>
<h4>The Authoring Platform</h4>
<h4><i>Enterprise Users</i></h4>
<p>
If you are an employee of an enterprise customer that has paid for a subscription to use the Authoring Platform, you’ll be able to use the Authoring Platform through your employer’s Account and on behalf of your employer to create Wraps, publish and distribute them to audiences and platforms of your choice, and view analytics data regarding the performance of and interactions with your Wraps.  For access to the Professional version of the Authoring Platform, your company must have no more than $2 million in annual revenue or 20 employees.  For access to the Small Business version of the Authoring Platform, your company must have no more than $20 million in annual revenue.  Additional terms may apply if your employer has entered into a separate enterprise agreement with us for use of the Authoring Platform.     
 </p>
<h4>Individual Users</h4>
<p>
Individual users may also access the Authoring Platform, either for free or on a paid subscription basis (the “Free Version” and the “Paid Version”, respectively), for their individual consumer use, via their personal Account created via the Site.  Individual users will not be able to access the full functionality of the Authoring Platform, which is reserved for enterprise customers.  If you choose to use the Free Version, you’ll be able to access and use only certain limited features of the Authoring Platform, and only for personal, non-commercial purposes (e.g. to create, publish, and distribute Wraps to your friends).  If you choose to use the Paid Version, you’ll be able to use additional functionality of the Authoring Platform not available to users of the Free Version, to create Wraps, publish and distribute them to audiences and platforms of your choice, and view analytics data regarding the performance of and interactions with your Wraps.  Wrap provides for a one-time 30 consecutive calendar day trial period (“Trial Period”) during which a user can utilize the Paid Version free of charge (“Trial License”).   Upon the expiration of the Trial Period, your free access to the Paid Version will automatically cease, and if you want to continue to use all the functions of the Paid Version, you’ll need to pay the applicable subscription fee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to charge a fee for access to and use of the Authoring Platform (and any versions thereof) at any time.      
 </p>
<h4>Interacting with Wraps and the Site</h4>
<p>
If you are an end-user that has received a Wrap via an html link (via email, SMS, social platform post, or ad network), you’ll be able to view the contents of such Wrap, interact with the pages within such Wrap, and share a link to the Wrap via email, SMS, or posting to a social platform (such as Facebook or Twitter).  Additionally, such end-users can create an Account with us through the Site, which will enable them to save Wraps to their Account.  These Terms also govern your general use of and interaction with the Site.
</p> 
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>
To the extent any portion of the Services is made available to you for a fee, you will be required to select a payment plan and provide Wrap with accurate information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You will promptly update your Account information with any changes in your payment information. You agree to pay Wrap the amount that is specified in the applicable payment plan in accordance with these Terms and any other terms associated with such payment plan, and you authorize Wrap to bill your payment instrument on a periodic basis in accordance with such terms. All amounts paid are non-refundable and we reserve the right to change our prices in the future. If we do change prices, we will provide notice of the change on the Site and through the Services and in an email to you at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Services after the price change goes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Wrap may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued must be received by the specified date or the Services may be terminated. Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. If you dispute any charges, you must notify Wrap within thirty (30) days after the date Wrap invoices you or bills your payment instrument, as applicable.  You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on Wrap’s net income.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment obligations with respect to enterprise customers that have entered into a separate enterprise agreement with us for use of the Authoring Platform will be as set forth in such separate enterprise agreement.

We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services (“Feedback”). You can submit Feedback by emailing us at admin@wrap.co. You grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license under any and all intellectual property rights that you own or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the Feedback for any purpose.

 <p>
Dispute Resolution<br/>
Governing Law<br/>
These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
 </p>
<h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>
<p>
You and Wrap Media, LLC agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. You acknowledge and agree that you and Wrap Media, LLC are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Wrap Media, LLC otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.
 </p>
<h3>Arbitration Rules</h3>
<p>
The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
 </p>
<h3>Arbitration Process</h3>
<p>
A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820 and a separate form for California residents at http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
 </p>
<h3>Arbitration Location and Procedure</h3>
<p>
Unless you and Wrap Media, LLC otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Wrap Media, LLC submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
 </p>
<h3>Arbitrator’s Decision</h3>
<p>
The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorney's’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Wrap Media, LLC will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
 </p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>
Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Wrap Media, LLC will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
</p> 
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>
Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Changes to Terms or Services” section above, if Wrap Media, LLC changes this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to admin@wrap.co) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated” date above or in the date of Wrap Media, LLC’s email to you notifying you of such change.
